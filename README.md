# What_kind_of_person_are_you-A_clustering_analysis
A clustering analysis using python to cluster people into personality types. This is my first implementation of a clustering algorithm!
The dataset is found from Kaggle with : https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/kernels?sortBy=hotness&group=everyone&pageSize=20&datasetId=117
The analysis is done on a jupyter notebook.
